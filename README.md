retrieve-data-using-jquery-php
==============================

Get data from database without navigation to some other page. 

This code enables you to access the database from an HTML page itself. The server querying code is written in a separate
PHP file and then called through AJAX via JQuery. 

This technique especially helps while validating forms and user inputs with existing database entries. Suppose you want to
validate a new entry email or username with existing ones in your database during a fresh registration process. This code 
can help you achieve that with JavaScript (Jquery) i.e. client side validation of data with database.
